## Introduction

Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a crucial task in machine learning, particularly in scenarios where models encounter data that differs significantly from the training set. Our approach leverages neighborhood shaping techniques to enhance the robustness of OOD detection in graph-based data. This repository contains the code and resources needed to reproduce our experiments and results.

## Installation

To get started with TopoOOD, follow these steps to install the necessary dependencies:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rigelizen/TopoOOD.git
   cd TopoOOD
   ```

2. Install the required packages. You can use `pip` to install the necessary libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. If you want to access the pre-trained models and datasets, download them from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Rigelizen/TopoOOD/releases) and follow the instructions provided there.

## Usage

After installation, you can use the code in this repository to perform OOD detection on your graph data. Here‚Äôs a basic example of how to run the main script:

```bash
python main.py --dataset your_dataset --model your_model
```

Replace `your_dataset` and `your_model` with your specific dataset and model configurations. For more detailed options, run:

```bash
python main.py --help
```

This command will display all available parameters and options.

## Methodology

Our methodology combines traditional graph-based techniques with modern deep learning approaches to improve OOD detection. Key components of our approach include:

- **Neighborhood Shaping**: This technique modifies the local structure of graphs to better represent the underlying data distribution.
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: We utilize GNNs to capture complex relationships within the data.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: We assess our model's performance using standard metrics such as AUC, F1-score, and accuracy.

### Neighborhood Shaping

Neighborhood shaping is a novel approach that involves adjusting the graph's local structure. By focusing on the relationships between nodes, we can create a more accurate representation of the data distribution. This section of the repository contains code snippets and examples demonstrating how to implement neighborhood shaping.

### Graph Neural Networks

Graph Neural Networks are essential for processing graph data. Our implementation supports various GNN architectures, allowing users to experiment with different models. Check the `models` directory for implementations of popular GNNs.

## Results

In our experiments, we benchmarked our method against several existing OOD detection techniques. The results demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy. Detailed results can be found in the `results` directory, which includes:

- Comparison tables
- Visualizations of model performance
- Example outputs from our method
